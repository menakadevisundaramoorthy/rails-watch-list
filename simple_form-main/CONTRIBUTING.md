## Contributing

1. If you have any questions about Simple Form, search the
[Wiki](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form/wiki)
or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/simple_form).
Do not post questions here.

2. If you find a security bug, **DO NOT** submit an issue here.
Please send an e-mail to [heartcombo@googlegroups.com](mailto:heartcombo@googlegroups.com)
instead.

3. Do a small search on the issues tracker before submitting your issue to
see if it was already reported or fixed. In case it was not, create your report
including Rails and Simple Form versions. If you are getting exceptions, please
include the full backtrace.

That's it! The more information you give, the more easy it becomes for us to
track it down and fix it. Ideal scenario would be adding the issue to Simple Form
test suite or to a sample application.

Thanks!
